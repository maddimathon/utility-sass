# Base Template

This is a very opinionated reset that aims to create a better, more consistent,
and more accessible version of browser built-in styles.  Forwards the package's
[config](../../config/index.docs.md), [tokens](../../tokens/index.docs.md), and
[library](../../lib/index.docs.md).

```scss
@forward 'pkg:@maddimathon/utility-sass/templates/base';
```
